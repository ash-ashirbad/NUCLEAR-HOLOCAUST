            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The nuclear holocaust refers to the catastrophic events resulting from the use of nuclear weapons, particularly during World War II. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki exemplify the devastating effects of nuclear warfare.To date, the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict occurred in 1945 with the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On August 6, 1945, a uranium gun-type device (code name "Little Boy") was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a plutonium implosion-type device (code name "Fat Man") was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. Together, these two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 people and contributed to the surrender of Japan, which occurred before any further nuclear weapons could be deployed.Since 1947, the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has visualized how close the world is to a nuclear war. The Doomsday Clock reached high points in 1953, when the Clock was set to two minutes until midnight after the U.S. and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs, and in 2018, following the failure of world leaders to address tensions relating to nuclear weapons and climate change issues.[19] Since 2023, the Clock has been set at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been.[20] The most recent advance of the Clock's time setting was largely attributed to the risk of nuclear escalation that arose from the Russian invasion of Ukraine</p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>The aftermath of nuclear war includes immediate loss of life, long-term health effects, environmental destruction, and global political tensions. Survivors often face profound psychological and social challenges.The immediate effects of nuclear war, the completeness of the devastation it brings, and the detailed accounting of the expected human suffering have all been the subject of numerous studies. We begin with a war scenario which provides the basis for estimating the demands placed on the medical system, and sets the parameters for determining the direct and indirect economic impacts. The results are then reexamined in the context of what is known about organizational behavior and transformation.The following calculations are based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's CRP-2B scenario which assumes that the United States is exposed to 6,559 megatons (Mt) of nuclear explosives targeted primarily at military installations and 250 centers of population exceeding 50,000.</p>

            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>Efforts to prevent nuclear holocaust include international treaties, disarmament campaigns, and advocacy for peaceful conflict resolution. Global cooperation is essential to reduce the threat of nuclear warfare.The United Nations has sought to eliminate nuclear weapons since its establishment. Disarmament is the best way to protect against the dangers of nuclear weapons, but it has been a difficult goal to achieve.Several treaties have been established to prevent nuclear proliferation and testing, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Monitoring systems for civilian nuclear activities should be improved.Nuclear energy should be developed in a way that strengthens security for all.A nuclear weapons convention should be created to make nuclear weapons illegal, similar to the chemical and biological weapons convention.The most developed countries should lead the international community towards a more cooperative environment.</p>
